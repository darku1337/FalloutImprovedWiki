          <li>| Fallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game, also referred to as simply Fallout, developed by Interplay and its division, Dragonplay, and self-published on September 30, 1997, is the first game in the Fallout series.</li>
      <li>| The game was initially intended to use Steve Jackson Games' GURPS system, but when Interplay made the decision to drop GURPS on February 12, 1997, it created its own system, SPECIAL.</li>
      <li>| Fallout is seen as the "spiritual successor" to Interplay's classic 1987 CRPG Wasteland.</li>
          <li>==========================</li>
      <li>Fallout is an RPG or role-playing game with turn-based combat and a pseudo-isometric view.

        <li>Fallout uses a character creation system called SPECIAL. SPECIAL is an acronym of Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck. These are the seven basic attributes of every character in the game. They are used to determine the skills and perks of the given character. The developers originally intended to use the GURPS system, but late in the development process they moved to the new SPECIAL system.</li>

        <li>There are 18 different skills in the game. They are ranked from 0% to 200%. The starting values for those skills at level one are determined by the player's seven basic attributes or SPECIAL, but most of those skills would fall between 0% and 50%. Every time the player gains a Level, they will be awarded skill points to be used to improve their skills, equal to five points plus twice their Intelligence. The player may choose to "Tag" three of the 18 skills. A tagged skill will improve at twice the normal rate.
          <li>==========================</li>
        Six combat skills: Small Guns, Big Guns, Energy Weapons, Unarmed, Melee Weapons, Throwing.
        Eight Active skills: First Aid, Doctor, Sneak, Lockpick, Steal, Traps, Science, Repair.
        Four passive skills: Speech, Barter, Gambling, Outdoorsman.
        Books found throughout the game world can also improve some of those skills permanently, although books are scarce early in the game. However, after a skill reaches a certain Level, books no longer have any impact on that skill. Some non-player characters can also improve Skills via training. How high a skill can be developed is affected by the character's Attributes: a character with a low Intelligence will not be able to boost their Science rating as high as a character with high Intelligence, for example.

        Some skills can also be improved while having certain items equipped. For example, equipping a lock pick would improve lockpicking skills. Chems can also temporarily boost player character's skills; however, they often have adverse effects such as addiction and withdrawal. As skills grow higher in rating, they begin to cost more skill points to increase.

        Main articles: Fallout traits, Perks
        At character creation, the player may choose two different traits and perks for their character. Traits are special character backgrounds. Most traits have profound effects on gameplay. A trait normally contains one beneficial effect and one detrimental effect. They are listed under perks in the character sheet. Once a Trait is chosen, it is impossible to change, except by using the Mutate! perk that lets them change one trait, one time.

        Perks in the game are special elements of the level-up system. Every three levels (or every four if the player character has the Skilled trait), the player is granted a perk of their choosing. Perks grant special effects, most of which are not obtainable via normal level up in the game, such as letting the player have more actions per turn. Unlike traits, most perks are purely beneficial: they are usually offset only by the infrequency of acquiring them.</li>
